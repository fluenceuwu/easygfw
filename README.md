# EasyGFW
## Bypass censorship in a breeze.
 
 This is a setup script to make the [GFW Trojan](https://github.com/trojan-gfw) setup quick and easy for anybody to do. All that you need is a server running a Debian-based distro that is outside of your censored area. 
 To run:
 ```
 sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluenceuwu/easygfw/main/setup.sh)"
 ```
